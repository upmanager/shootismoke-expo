### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaurymartiny/shit-i-smoke
cd shit-i-smoke
yarn install

# Get your Air Quality Database token from https://aqicn.org/json-api/doc/
# and put it into app.json
# Note: Google Maps api keys are not necessary while developing
cp app.example.json app.json

yarn start
```

This app is created with Expo, using React Native. When you run `yarn start`, the packager will show, and you can either:
- install the Expo app, scan the displayed QR code, and run the app on your mobile phone directly.
- press `a` to open the Android simulator.
- press `i` to open the iOS simulator.

All the code lives in the `App/` folder. The app itself is pretty small, so it should be fairly easy to navigate through the files.
