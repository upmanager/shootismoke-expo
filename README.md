If you find a bug, or if you have an idea of a cool feature, please file an issue here. We really appreciate feedback and inputs.

If you would like to help coding please read the Getting Started guide.

### Getting Started

Before developing the app, you need to fetch your own API tokens for the following services:

| Service                 | Url                                                                                 | Comments                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| World Air Quality Index | http://aqicn.org/api/                                                               | Required.                                               |
| Google Geocoding        | https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro                    | Optional, but recommended for showing precise location. |
| Algolia Places          | https://community.algolia.com/places/rest.html (`Get Started` button on the bottom) | Optional, lower API rates if not provided.              |
| Google Maps for iOS     | https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start                      | Optional in development.                                |
| Google Maps for Android | https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/                       | Optional in development.                                |

Then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaurymartiny/shit-i-smoke
cd shit-i-smoke
yarn install

cp app.example.json app.json
# Replaces the API keys placeholders with your own tokens in app.json

yarn start
```

This app is created with Expo, using React Native. When you run `yarn start`, the packager will show, and you can either:

* install the Expo app, scan the displayed QR code, and run the app on your mobile phone directly.
* press `a` to open the Android simulator.
* press `i` to open the iOS simulator.

All the code lives in the `App/` folder. The app itself is pretty small, so it should be fairly easy to navigate through the files.
